## [1.2.1-phase-3-enrollment-complete] - 2024-11-19

**Phase 3: Client Enrollment System Complete** ✅

### Context
Completed the client enrollment workflow for email campaigns. Built quote acceptance integration, manual enrollment interface, and flexible campaign selection system based on user feedback prioritizing firm control over automated matching.

### Added

#### Quote Acceptance Enrollment Flow
**Files:** `components/campaigns/campaign-enrollment-modal.tsx`, `components/quotes/quote-actions.tsx`

- ✅ **Campaign enrollment modal** on quote acceptance
  - Shows when accepting quotes with linked clients
  - Displays ALL active campaigns (not just matching)
  - Green "Recommended" badge for campaigns matching client's life stage
  - Firms can select any campaign regardless of matching criteria
  - Option to skip enrollment and just accept quote
  - Multiple campaign selection support

- ✅ **Quote action handling**
  - Handles quotes with and without client_id
  - Opens modal only when client exists
  - Gracefully accepts quote when no client linked
  - Prevents button from breaking on null client_id

#### Manual Enrollment System
**Files:** `app/(dashboard)/campaigns/[id]/subscribers/page.tsx`, `components/campaigns/manual-enrollment-form.tsx`, `components/campaigns/subscribers-list.tsx`

- ✅ **Subscribers tab** in campaign detail pages
  - Server-side data fetching with proper Next.js 15 async params
  - Client/subscriber count statistics
  - Enrolled subscribers list with status
  - Available clients for enrollment

- ✅ **Manual enrollment interface**
  - Search clients by name or email
  - Filter by life stage (FTB, moving-up, investor, retired, downsizing)
  - Real-time filtering with debouncing
  - Batch enrollment capability
  - Shows client badges and metadata

- ✅ **Subscriber management**
  - View all enrolled subscribers
  - Status tracking (active, paused, completed, unsubscribed)
  - Enrollment date and source tracking
  - Unenroll button with confirmation
  - Email count per subscriber

#### Campaign Enrollment Service
**File:** `services/campaign-enrollment.service.ts`

- ✅ **Flexible campaign matching**
  - `findMatchingCampaigns()` - Returns ALL active campaigns
  - Added `matches_criteria` boolean flag to each campaign
  - Matches based on client life stage vs campaign target_life_stages
  - Empty target stages = matches everyone

- ✅ **Multi-campaign enrollment**
  - `enrollClientInCampaigns()` - Enroll in multiple campaigns at once
  - Creates campaign_subscribers records
  - Populates email_queue with all campaign templates
  - Returns enrollment count and queued email count

- ✅ **Email queue population**
  - Schedules all campaign templates automatically
  - Calculates `scheduled_for` based on `days_after_enrollment` and `send_time_utc`
  - Personalizes subject and body with variable replacement
  - Stores personalization_data for tracking

- ✅ **Variable replacement**
  - Supports {{client_name}}, {{firm_name}}, {{property_address}}
  - Fetches tenant and property data for replacement
  - Handles missing data gracefully

- ✅ **Unenrollment**
  - `unenrollClient()` - Remove client from campaign
  - Updates subscriber status to 'unsubscribed'
  - Records unenroll timestamp

#### API Endpoints
**Files:** `app/api/campaigns/enroll/route.ts`, `app/api/campaigns/subscribers/[id]/route.ts`

- ✅ **GET /api/campaigns/enroll?clientId=xxx**
  - Get all active campaigns with match indicators
  - Returns campaigns with `matches_criteria` field
  - Used by enrollment modal

- ✅ **POST /api/campaigns/enroll**
  - Enroll client in multiple campaigns
  - Body: `{ clientId, campaignIds: string[] }`
  - Returns enrollment count and queued email count

- ✅ **DELETE /api/campaigns/subscribers/[id]**
  - Unenroll client from campaign
  - Requires subscriber record ID
  - Updates status to unsubscribed

### Fixed

#### Bug 1: Quote Acceptance Button Not Working
**File:** `components/quotes/quote-actions.tsx`

**Problem:** When quote had no client_id (null), clicking "Mark as Accepted" did nothing
**Root Cause:** Modal conditional `{quote.client_id && <CampaignEnrollmentModal />}` prevented modal from rendering, but button handler still tried to show it
**Fix:** Added null check to `handleAcceptQuote()` - if no client_id, accept quote directly without modal
```typescript
const handleAcceptQuote = () => {
  if (!quote.client_id) {
    handleStatusChange('accepted')
    return
  }
  setShowEnrollmentModal(true)
}
```
**Result:** ✅ Quote acceptance works for both linked and unlinked quotes

#### Bug 2: TypeScript Build Failures - Schema Mismatches
**Files:** Multiple service files and components

**Problems:**
- `clients.full_name` doesn't exist (should be `first_name + last_name`)
- `tenants.firm_name` doesn't exist (should be `name`)
- `campaign_subscribers` missing `tenant_id` in insert
- `email_queue` schema mismatch (personalized_subject vs subject)

**Fixes:**
- Updated `campaign-enrollment.service.ts` to use `first_name` and `last_name`
- Changed `tenant.firm_name` to `tenant.name` everywhere
- Added `tenant_id` to all campaign_subscribers inserts
- Fixed email_queue insert to match actual schema:
  - `to_email`, `to_name`, `subject`, `body_html`, `body_text`
  - Removed non-existent `personalized_*` fields

**Result:** ✅ Zero TypeScript errors, production build passes

#### Bug 3: No Campaigns Showing in Modal
**File:** `services/campaign-enrollment.service.ts`

**Problem:** Enrollment modal showed "No matching campaigns" for clients without matching life stages
**User Feedback:** "firm wants to be able to have the ability to select whatever options they want when enrolling a client for cross selling"
**Root Cause:** Service filtered campaigns to return only matches
**Fix:** Changed from `.filter()` to `.map()` to return ALL campaigns with `matches_criteria` flag
```typescript
// Before - only returned matching campaigns
const matchingCampaigns = campaigns.filter(campaign => {
  // matching logic
  return matches
})

// After - return all with match indicator
const campaignsWithMatching = campaigns.map(campaign => {
  const matches = /* matching logic */
  return { ...campaign, matches_criteria: matches }
})
```
**Result:** ✅ All active campaigns shown, recommended ones have green badge

#### Bug 4: Campaign Status Confusion
**Issue:** User saw "No active campaigns" despite having created campaigns
**Root Cause:** Campaigns were in "Paused" status
**Learning:** Only campaigns with `status = 'active'` appear in enrollment flows
**Solution:** User activated campaigns via dashboard
**Documentation:** Added to STATUS.md under "Important Learnings"

### Changed

#### Campaign Enrollment Modal UX
**File:** `components/campaigns/campaign-enrollment-modal.tsx`

- Updated empty state message from "No matching campaigns" to "No active campaigns"
- Added "Recommended" badge to campaigns with `matches_criteria = true`
- Updated info text to emphasize firm control: "Recommended campaigns match the client's profile, but you can select any campaign"
- Removed misleading copy about client not matching campaigns
- Interface now shows: campaign name, recommended badge, description, email count, duration, campaign type

### Technical Highlights

#### Firm Control Over Cross-Selling
- User-driven design decision based on explicit feedback
- Automated matching provides recommendations, not restrictions
- Firms have full flexibility to enroll any client in any campaign
- Visual indicators (green "Recommended" badge) guide without limiting

#### Data Flow
```
Quote Acceptance → Modal Opens → Fetch All Active Campaigns →
Mark Matching Campaigns → User Selects → Enroll API Call →
Create Subscribers → Populate Email Queue → Schedule Emails
```

#### Email Scheduling Logic
```
Template send_time_utc: "09:00:00"
Template days_after_enrollment: 3
Enrolled at: 2024-11-19 14:30:00

Scheduled for: 2024-11-22 09:00:00 UTC
(3 days after enrollment, at 9 AM UTC)
```

### Database Schema Verified
- ✅ `clients` table uses `first_name`, `last_name` (not `full_name`)
- ✅ `tenants` table uses `name` (not `firm_name`)
- ✅ `campaign_subscribers` requires `tenant_id`
- ✅ `email_queue` uses `subject`, `body_html`, `to_email`, `to_name`
- ✅ All foreign key relationships validated

### Commits
- **Commit:** `1684ee6` - Fix: Handle quote acceptance when client_id is null
- **Commit:** `e174077` - Fix: Correct database column names in enrollment system
- **Commit:** `1c85809` - Docs: Add future features documentation
- **Commit:** `671e1a3` - Feat: Show all campaigns in enrollment modal with recommended badges
- **Branch:** `claude/phase-2-demo-complete-01MvsFgXfzypH55ReBQoerMy`
- **Status:** Committed and pushed to remote, auto-deployed to Vercel

### User Testing Results
✅ Quote acceptance with client enrollment - Working
✅ Quote acceptance without client (null client_id) - Working
✅ Manual enrollment in Subscribers tab - Working
✅ Campaign activation/pause - Working
✅ All campaigns showing in modal - Working
✅ Recommended badges displaying - Working
✅ Email queue population - Working (verified in Supabase)

### What's Next
- **Phase 4:** Form-to-client/property automation (documented in FUTURE_FEATURES.md)
- **Email Sending:** Vercel Cron job runs daily at 9 AM UTC
- **Engagement Tracking:** Open/click tracking via SendGrid webhooks (future)
- **Analytics:** Campaign ROI and conversion funnels (future)

## [1.1.2-logo-fix-attempted] - 2024-11-17 (Evening Session 2)

**Continued from Previous Session - Logo Rendering Issue** 🔧

### Context
This session continued from earlier deployment session where logo rendering was identified as a problem. User reported that logos still don't display in PDF quotes or settings preview after the initial fix attempts.

### What Was Attempted

#### Logo Rendering Fix - Base64 Conversion Approach
**Problem:** Logos not displaying in PDF quotes or settings preview despite earlier attempts
**Hypothesis:** `@react-pdf/renderer` and browser `<img>` tags can't load Supabase Storage public URLs due to CORS

**Solution Attempted:** Convert Supabase Storage URLs to base64 data URLs

**Implementation:**
1. **app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts** (Lines 51-68)
   ```typescript
   // Convert logo URL to base64 if present
   let logoBase64: string | undefined
   if (brandingSettings.logo_url) {
     try {
       const logoResponse = await fetch(brandingSettings.logo_url)
       if (logoResponse.ok) {
         const logoBuffer = await logoResponse.arrayBuffer()
         const logoBytes = Buffer.from(logoBuffer)
         const contentType = logoResponse.headers.get('content-type') || 'image/png'
         logoBase64 = `data:${contentType};base64,${logoBytes.toString('base64')}`
       }
     } catch (logoError) {
       console.error('Error fetching logo for PDF:', logoError)
     }
   }

   // Pass base64 logo to PDF generator
   branding: {
     logo_url: logoBase64 || brandingSettings.logo_url,
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **app/(dashboard)/settings/branding/page.tsx** (Lines 34-50)
   ```typescript
   // Convert logo URL to base64 for reliable preview display
   if (brandingSettings.logo_url) {
     try {
       const logoResponse = await fetch(brandingSettings.logo_url)
       if (logoResponse.ok) {
         const logoBuffer = await logoResponse.arrayBuffer()
         const logoBytes = Buffer.from(logoBuffer)
         const contentType = logoResponse.headers.get('content-type') || 'image/png'
         brandingSettings.logo_url = `data:${contentType};base64,${logoBytes.toString('base64')}`
       }
     } catch (logoError) {
       console.error('Error fetching logo for preview:', logoError)
     }
   }
   ```

**Result:** ❌ **DID NOT WORK** - User confirmed logos still not displaying

### Current Problems That Need Fixing

#### 1. Logo Not Rendering in PDF Quotes ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** BROKEN - Multiple fix attempts unsuccessful
**User Impact:** HIGH - Branded PDFs are a key selling feature
**What works:**
- ✅ Custom brand colors in PDF
- ✅ Firm name and tagline in PDF
- ✅ Logo uploads successfully to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Logo URL is saved to database

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Logo image not visible in generated PDF
- ❌ Logo preview not showing in settings page

**What's been tried:**
1. Added `Image` component from `@react-pdf/renderer`
2. Added conditional rendering for logo vs firm name text
3. Added error handling with crossOrigin attribute
4. Attempted base64 conversion (tonight's session)

**Possible root causes to investigate:**
1. **Supabase Storage CORS configuration**
   - Bucket may not allow requests from @react-pdf/renderer
   - May need to add specific CORS headers
   - Check if bucket is truly PUBLIC

2. **@react-pdf/renderer Image limitations**
   - Library may not support external URLs at all
   - May require images to be served from same domain
   - May have issues with Supabase signed URLs

3. **Base64 fetch failing silently**
   - Server-side fetch might be blocked by firewall/network
   - Supabase might require authentication even for public buckets
   - Need to check server logs for fetch errors

4. **Image format incompatibility**
   - @react-pdf/renderer might not support all image formats
   - May need specific PNG/JPEG encoding
   - SVG might not be supported

**Next steps to try:**
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for fetch errors
2. Test if base64 string is actually being generated (add console.log)
3. Verify Supabase Storage bucket is PUBLIC with no RLS restrictions
4. Try uploading a simple test PNG and see if that renders
5. Check @react-pdf/renderer documentation for Image component requirements
6. Consider alternative: Store logos as base64 strings directly in database
7. Consider alternative: Proxy logo through Next.js API route to avoid CORS

#### 2. Logo Preview Not Showing in Settings ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status:** BROKEN - Same underlying issue as PDF
**User Impact:** MEDIUM - Users can't see their uploaded logo
**What works:**
- ✅ Logo upload completes successfully
- ✅ Logo URL is saved
- ✅ Error handling shows helpful message

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Preview `<img>` tag fails to load image
- ❌ Even with crossOrigin="anonymous" attribute

**Root cause likely same as PDF issue** - Supabase Storage CORS or public access configuration

### What Worked Tonight ✅

1. **TypeScript Validation Passed**
   - Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` with no errors
   - Code changes are syntactically correct

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Previous session created comprehensive docs:
     - SESSION-SUMMARY-2024-11-17.md
     - Updated CHANGELOG.md
     - Updated STATUS.md

3. **Git Workflow**
   - Successfully committed changes
   - Pushed to branch: `claude/phase-2-demo-complete-01MvsFgXfzypH55ReBQoerMy`
   - Vercel will auto-deploy (if configured)

### What Didn't Work Tonight ❌

1. **Logo rendering fix**
   - Base64 conversion approach didn't solve the problem
   - User confirmed: "that still didnt fix it"

2. **Local build test**
   - Build failed due to Google Fonts network restrictions
   - Error: HTTP 403 from fonts.googleapis.com
   - Not related to our code - environment issue
   - TypeScript compilation succeeded (validates our code is correct)

### Files Modified Tonight
- `app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts` - Added base64 logo conversion
- `app/(dashboard)/settings/branding/page.tsx` - Added base64 logo conversion
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file (documentation)
- `STATUS.md` - Status update (documentation)

### Commits Tonight
- Commit: `4e52ea9` - Fix: Logo rendering in PDF quotes and settings preview
- Status: Pushed to remote branch
- Deployment: Should trigger Vercel rebuild

### User Feedback
- "ok that still didnt fix it"
- User requested: Stop coding, update docs only
- User wants: List of what worked, what didn't work, current problems

### Meeting Tomorrow
- User has meeting Tuesday (tomorrow)
- Current state: Production app works except logos
- Demo-able features:
  - ✅ Analytics dashboard with revenue charts
  - ✅ Client management system
  - ✅ Branded PDF quotes (colors and text)
  - ✅ Email sending
  - ⚠️ Logo rendering (still broken)

### Recommendation for Tomorrow's Session

**Priority 1: Fix Logo Rendering**
- Investigate Supabase Storage bucket configuration
- Check deployment logs for base64 fetch errors
- Try simpler test: Upload small PNG, test if it renders
- Consider storing logos as base64 in database directly

**Priority 2: Test Current Deployment**
- Verify Vercel rebuilt with tonight's changes
- Test if base64 approach works in production (might work despite local testing)
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

**Priority 3: Prepare Demo Fallback**
- Document workaround: Use firm name text instead of logo
- Emphasize working features: colors, charts, analytics, emails
- Logo can be "Phase 2.1" enhancement if needed

## [1.1.1-production-deployment] - 2024-11-17

**Production Deployment & Bug Fixes** 🚀

### Deployment
- ✅ Deployed Phase 2 to Vercel production environment
- ✅ Branch: `claude/phase-2-demo-complete-01MvsFgXfzypH55ReBQoerMy`
- ✅ Live URL: Vercel app with all Phase 2 features
- ✅ Database: Using existing Supabase instance with "Test" tenant
- ✅ Demo data: 15 clients, 17 quotes, £81,420 revenue

### Fixed - Critical Production Issues

#### Issue 1: TypeScript Build Errors (5 errors fixed)
**Problem:** Vercel deployment failed due to TypeScript strict mode errors

**Fixes:**
1. **clients/[id]/page.tsx - Quote array typing**
   ```typescript
   // Problem: TypeScript didn't know about Supabase joined quotes
   const { client } = clientResult

   // Solution: Properly type the joined data
   type Quote = Database['public']['Tables']['quotes']['Row']
   const quotes = (client.quotes as unknown as Quote[]) || []
   ```

2. **clients/page.tsx - Undefined array**
   ```typescript
   // Problem: 'clients' is possibly 'undefined'
   const clients = 'clients' in clientsResult ? clientsResult.clients : []

   // Solution: Add null check
   const clients = ('clients' in clientsResult && clientsResult.clients)
     ? clientsResult.clients : []
   ```

3. **analytics-charts.tsx - Pie chart percent**
   ```typescript
   // Problem: Property 'percent' is possibly 'undefined'
   label={({ name, percent }) => `${name}: ${(percent * 100).toFixed(0)}%`}

   // Solution: Add null check
   label={({ name, percent }) => `${name}: ${percent ? (percent * 100).toFixed(0) : '0'}%`}
   ```

4. **branding-settings-form.tsx - Wrong import**
   ```typescript
   // Problem: Button imported from wrong module
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/card'

   // Solution: Import from correct module
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
   ```

5. **branding.service.ts - Undefined function**
   ```typescript
   // Problem: createSupabaseClient not defined after refactor
   const supabase = await createSupabaseClient()

   // Solution: Use renamed import
   const supabase = await createClient()
   ```

#### Issue 2: Email Not Sending on Quote Creation
**Problem:** When creating a quote with "Save and Send to Client", email never sent

**Root Cause:** Form created quote with status='sent' but never called send email API

**Solution:** Added email sending logic in quote-form-with-property.tsx
```typescript
// After creating quote successfully
if (status === 'sent' && data.client_email) {
  try {
    const sendResponse = await fetch(`/api/quotes/${result.quote.id}/send`, {
      method: 'POST',
    })

    if (!sendResponse.ok) {
      const errorData = await sendResponse.json()
      setError(`Quote created but failed to send email: ${errorData.error}`)
      // Still redirect so user can manually send
      router.push(`/quotes/${result.quote.id}`)
      return
    }
  } catch (emailError) {
    console.error('Error sending quote email:', emailError)
    setError('Quote created but failed to send email. You can send it from the quote details page.')
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Emails now send automatically when creating quote with "sent" status

#### Issue 3: Branding Colors Not in PDF Quotes
**Problem:** PDF quotes showed hardcoded blue (#2563EB) instead of custom branding

**Root Cause:** QuotePDF component didn't accept or use branding settings

**Solution 1:** Updated QuotePDF to accept branding
```typescript
// lib/pdf/quote-template.tsx
interface QuotePDFProps {
  quote: QuoteWithRelations
  tenantName: string
  branding?: {
    primary_color?: string
    logo_url?: string
    firm_name?: string
    tagline?: string
  }
}

export const QuotePDF: React.FC<QuotePDFProps> = ({ quote, tenantName, branding }) => {
  // Use branding colors or defaults
  const primaryColor = branding?.primary_color || '#2563EB'
  const firmName = branding?.firm_name || tenantName

  // Apply to header
  <View style={[styles.header, { borderBottomColor: primaryColor }]}>
    <Text style={[styles.logo, { color: primaryColor }]}>{firmName}</Text>

  // Apply to total section
  <View style={[styles.totalRow, { borderTopColor: primaryColor }]}>
    <Text style={[styles.totalLabel, { color: primaryColor }]}>Total Amount</Text>
```

**Solution 2:** Updated send API to fetch and pass branding
```typescript
// app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts
// Fetch branding settings
const brandingSettings = await getBrandingSettings(membership.tenant_id)

// Generate PDF with branding
const pdfBuffer = await renderToBuffer(
  QuotePDF({
    quote,
    tenantName,
    branding: {
      primary_color: brandingSettings.primary_color,
      logo_url: brandingSettings.logo_url,
      firm_name: brandingSettings.firm_name,
      tagline: brandingSettings.tagline,
    }
  }) as any
)
```

**Result:** ✅ PDF quotes now show custom brand colors and firm name

#### Issue 4: Branding Settings Not Saving (RLS Permission Error)
**Problem:** Uploading logo and clicking Save showed "Failed to save settings"

**Root Cause:** Regular Supabase client has Row Level Security restrictions

**Solution:** Created service role client for admin operations
```typescript
// lib/supabase/server.ts
export function createServiceRoleClient() {
  return createSupabaseClient<Database>(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!,
    {
      auth: {
        autoRefreshToken: false,
        persistSession: false
      }
    }
  )
}

// services/branding.service.ts - Use service role for writes
export async function updateBrandingSettings(
  tenantId: string,
  settings: Partial<BrandingSettings>
) {
  const supabase = createServiceRoleClient() // Bypasses RLS
  // ... rest of update logic
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Branding settings now save successfully

### Known Issues - Still Need Fixing

#### Logo Not Rendering in PDF or Preview ⚠️
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED - Colors work, logo still broken

**Current State:**
- ✅ Brand colors working in PDF
- ✅ Firm name and tagline working in PDF
- ❌ Logo image not showing in PDF
- ❌ Logo preview not showing in settings form

**What Was Tried:**
1. Added Image import to PDF template
2. Added logo rendering logic with conditional display
3. Added error handling to form preview with crossOrigin attribute
4. Verified logo URL is being passed to PDF generator

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// lib/pdf/quote-template.tsx
import { Image } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

{branding?.logo_url ? (
  <Image
    src={branding.logo_url}
    style={{ width: 120, height: 'auto', maxHeight: 50, marginBottom: 8, objectFit: 'contain' }}
  />
) : (
  <Text style={[styles.logo, { color: primaryColor }]}>{firmName}</Text>
)}
```

**Suspected Issues:**
1. **CORS Problem:** Supabase Storage might not allow cross-origin image access
2. **Public URL Issue:** Storage bucket might not be properly configured as public
3. **RLS on Storage:** Row Level Security might be blocking anonymous access to images

**Next Steps to Fix:**
1. Check Supabase Storage bucket `firm-logos` CORS settings
2. Verify bucket is set to PUBLIC
3. Check RLS policies on storage.objects table
4. Test logo URL directly in browser to confirm it's accessible
5. May need to add CORS headers to Supabase Storage bucket
6. Consider using base64 encoded images if CORS can't be fixed

**Workaround:** Logo will still save and can be uploaded. Colors and text branding work perfectly.

### Technical Debt
- Logo display needs CORS/Storage configuration fix
- Consider migrating to base64 images for PDFs if storage access remains problematic

### Fixed

#### Database Schema Issues
- ✅ Fixed property price column mismatch
  - Seed script was using `price` field
  - Database schema uses `purchase_price`
  - Updated all property insertions
- ✅ Fixed property type enum mismatch
  - Seed script was using `house`/`flat`
  - Database enum uses `residential`/`commercial`
  - Updated all property insertions
- ✅ Fixed quote schema mismatches
  - Converted `property_value` → `transaction_value`
  - Converted `legal_fees` → `base_fee`
  - Combined fees into `disbursements`
  - Calculated `vat_amount` (20% of base + disbursements)
  - Calculated `total_amount` correctly
  - Added `client_name` and `client_email` fields
  - Added `accepted_at` timestamps for accepted quotes

#### Quote Number Conflicts
- ✅ Fixed global quote number collisions
  - Quote numbers were globally unique across all tenants
  - Multiple tenants caused "duplicate key" errors
  - Solution: Tenant-specific quote prefixes
  - Example: Tenant `d9a4...` uses `Q-d9a4-001`, `Q-d9a4-002`, etc.

#### Quote Status Validation
- ✅ Fixed status check constraint violation
  - Seed script used `declined` status
  - Database only accepts: draft, pending, sent, accepted, rejected, expired, cancelled
  - Changed `declined` → `rejected` throughout

#### Service Naming Conflicts
- ✅ Fixed createClient function name collision
  - Seed script function conflicted with Supabase import
  - Renamed Supabase import to `createSupabaseClient`
  - Applied across all service files

#### Seed Script Improvements
- ✅ Fixed --clean flag parsing
  - Flag was being treated as tenant name
  - Now filters out flags starting with `--`
  - Works correctly: `npm run seed -- --clean`

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with Phase 2 features

#### [2024-11-16] Quote Detail Page 404 Errors - Critical Bug Fix

**Commit:** `066a8dd`

**Symptoms:**
- ALL quote detail pages were failing with 404 errors
- Clicking the eye icon in the Actions column on quotes page resulted in "Quote not found"
- Quote detail pages at `/quotes/[id]` were completely broken

**Root Cause:**
- Wrong column reference in Supabase query
- `services/quote.service.ts:327` had `created_by_user:profiles(*)` join
- This column doesn't exist in the database schema
- Supabase query failed, returning null/error, which was treated as "not found"

**Discovery:**
- Found while testing quote viewing functionality
- Error only occurred when trying to view quote details
- Quotes list page worked fine (no profiles join)

**Fix:**
- Removed the broken `created_by_user:profiles(*)` join from `getQuote()` function
- Query now only joins `property:properties(*)` and `tenant:tenants(*)`
- Both of these relationships exist and work correctly

**Files Changed:**
- `services/quote.service.ts` (line 327)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Quote detail pages now load correctly
- ✅ Action icons in quotes table work
- ✅ Users can view full quote information
- ✅ Edit and send quote functionality restored

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: quote, error } = await supabase
  .from('quotes')
  .select(`
    *,
    property:properties(*),
    tenant:tenants(*),
    created_by_user:profiles(*)  // ❌ BROKEN - doesn't exist
  `)
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data: quote, error } = await supabase
  .from('quotes')
  .select(`
    *,
    property:properties(*),
    tenant:tenants(*)  // ✅ WORKS
  `)
```

#### [2024-11-16] Next.js 15 Async Params in Dynamic Routes

**Commits:** `ca7891a`, `00e1bc7`

**Problem:**
- Next.js 15 made `params` and `searchParams` async Promises
- Dynamic routes `[id]` were accessing params synchronously
- Caused 404 errors and runtime errors

**Fixed Files:**
- `app/(dashboard)/quotes/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/quotes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/properties/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/properties/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/quotes/new/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/quotes/page.tsx`
- `app/(dashboard)/properties/page.tsx`

**Solution:**
Changed `params: { id: string }` to `params: Promise<{ id: string }>` and added `await`:
```typescript
// Before
export default async function Page({ params }: PageProps) {
  const result = await getQuote(params.id)
}

// After
export default async function Page({ params }: PageProps) {
  const { id } = await params
  const result = await getQuote(id)
}
```

#### [2024-11-16] Email Sending & PDF Generation Broken - Critical Bug Fix

**Commit:** `e0c87de`

**Symptoms:**
- Email sending completely broken - "Send Quote" button failed silently
- PDF generation also failing
- These features worked yesterday before Next.js 15 migration

**Root Cause:**
- API routes also need async params in Next.js 15 (not just page routes)
- `/app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts` - Email sending endpoint
- `/app/api/quotes/[id]/pdf/route.ts` - PDF generation endpoint
- Both were using synchronous `params: { id: string }` instead of async

**Discovery:**
- User reported emails not sending after today's fixes
- Realized API routes were missed in the Next.js 15 async params migration

**Fix:**
Changed API route params from synchronous to async:

```typescript
// Before
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  const quoteResult = await getQuote(params.id)
}

// After
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await params
  const quoteResult = await getQuote(id)
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/quotes/[id]/send/route.ts` (lines 12, 21, 87)
- `app/api/quotes/[id]/pdf/route.ts` (lines 10, 19)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Email sending now works correctly
- ✅ PDF generation restored
- ✅ Quote workflow fully functional end-to-end

**Note:** This was the final piece of the Next.js 15 migration. All dynamic routes (pages AND API routes) now properly handle async params.

---

#### [2024-11-16] Settings Layout Unused Imports

**Commit:** `540f24b`

**Problem:**
- `app/(dashboard)/settings/layout.tsx` imported `usePathname` (client hook)
- Layout is a server component (`async function`)
- Build error: "You're importing a component that needs usePathname"

**Solution:**
- Removed unused `usePathname` import
- Removed unused `Link` import
- `SettingsNav` component already uses `'use client'` directive correctly

---

#### [2024-11-16] LBTT Calculator Implementation Fixes

**Commits:** `1174ef8`, `a334d04`, `995f731`, `691e1e9`

**1. TypeScript Export Conflict**
- Problem: Duplicate `formatCurrency` exports from `lbtt.ts` and `fees.ts`
- Fix: Made both functions internal (removed export keyword)
- Result: Module imports work correctly

**2. ADS Rate Incorrect**
- Problem: ADS was 6% (should be 8%)
- Fix: Updated `ADS_RATE` from 0.06 to 0.08
- Result: £200k property shows £16,000 ADS (was £12,000)

**3. First-Time Buyer Calculation Wrong**
- Problem: Only worked for properties ≤ £175k, incorrectly subtracted £175k threshold
- Fix: Implemented proper extended nil-rate band system with `FIRST_TIME_BUYER_BANDS`
- Result: £200k property shows £500 LBTT for first-time buyers (£25k @ 2%)

**4. Mutual Exclusion Missing**
- Problem: Could select both first-time buyer and ADS simultaneously
- Fix: Added disabled states and onChange handlers to enforce mutual exclusion
- Result: Selecting one option disables and unchecks the other

---

#### [2024-11-16] Duplicate Content in Documentation

**Commit:** `5dea518`

**Problem:**
- `docs/PROJECT-ROADMAP.md` had entire document duplicated (1,322 lines instead of 651)
- Made file difficult to read and maintain

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate content starting at line 654
- File now properly ends at line 651
