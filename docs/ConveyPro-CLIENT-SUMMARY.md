# ConveyPro - Client-Facing Summary
## What Your Solicitors Are Getting

---

## How It Actually Works

### **Current Workflow (Before ConveyPro):**

1. Client calls solicitor: "How much for conveyancing?"
2. Solicitor/receptionist asks questions over phone (15 minutes)
3. Takes notes, promises to call back
4. Staff member manually calculates LBTT using online calculator
5. Staff member manually calculates legal fees based on price bands
6. Types everything into Word document
7. Finds T&Cs document, attaches to email
8. Emails quote to client
9. **Total time: 45-60 minutes per quote**
10. Client often shops around to 3-4 other solicitors
11. Lowest price usually wins

### **New Workflow (With ConveyPro):**

1. Client calls solicitor: "How much for conveyancing?"
2. Receptionist/paralegal logs into ConveyPro dashboard
3. Creates new quote, fills in form while on phone with client:
   - Property address
   - Property price
   - Property type (house/flat)
   - Transaction type (purchase/sale)
   - Client name and email
   - First time buyer? (affects LBTT)
   - Additional property? (triggers ADS tax)
4. **System instantly calculates:**
   - Full LBTT breakdown (all tax bands shown)
   - Legal fees (based on their custom pricing)
   - Total costs with VAT
5. Staff previews the quote on screen
6. Attaches any additional documents:
   - Terms & Conditions
   - Service guide
   - Client care letter
   - Office brochure
7. Clicks "Send to Client"
8. Professional branded PDF + documents emailed instantly
9. **Total time: 5-8 minutes per quote**
10. Client receives comprehensive quote package
11. Cross-selling emails start automatically

---

## What Makes This Different

### **It's a Staff Tool, Not a Public Form**

❌ **NOT:** Public website where clients fill out forms themselves  
✅ **YES:** Internal dashboard where YOUR staff create quotes for clients

**Why This Approach:**
- Maintains personal touch (phone/in-person consultation)
- Staff can explain options as they go
- Can upsell services during conversation
- Captures client details accurately
- Professional impression maintained
- No "self-service" discount pressure

**Visual Form Builder (Your Dashboard Only):**

## Phase 3: Cross-Selling Intelligence

**The Hidden Revenue:**

When a solicitor does conveyancing for £1,200, they're leaving £1,000-3,000 on the table:
- Will writing: £500-800
- Power of Attorney: £350
- Executry services: £2,500+
- Estate planning: £1,500+

**The Problem:**
- Solicitors are too busy to follow up
- Don't know the right time to ask
- Clients forget about other services
- No system to track opportunities

**The Solution: Automated Educational Sequences**

### **How It Works:**

**Day 0: Client gets quote via ConveyPro**
- System notes: First-time buyer, age 32, £275k property, family home

**Day 1: Missives concluded**
- System sends celebratory email
- Soft mention: "Protect your new investment..."
- CTA: "Learn about Will writing"

**Day 3: Educational email**
```
Subject: What happens to your new home without a Will?

Dear Mr. Smith,

Congratulations again on your new home purchase! While we're 
handling your conveyancing, we wanted to share some important 
information many first-time buyers overlook.

In Scotland, without a Will:
- Your property might not go to who you expect
- Your partner may not automatically inherit
- The process can take 12-18 months
- Costs can be 3x higher

We've helped hundreds of clients protect their families with 
simple, affordable Wills (from £800 for mirror wills).

consultation: [Book Now]

Best regards,
Smith & Jones Solicitors

P.S. This doesn't delay your conveyancing - we can handle 
both simultaneously.
```

**Day 7: Social proof email**
```
Subject: How the Johnsons secured their family's future

just purchased their first home in Glasgow.
